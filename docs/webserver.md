# Web Server Guide

This guide explains how to connect your CrossPoint Reader to WiFi and use the built-in web server to upload EPUB files from your computer or phone.

## Overview

CrossPoint Reader includes a built-in web server that allows you to:

- Upload EPUB files wirelessly from any device on the same WiFi network
- Browse and manage files on your device's SD card
- Create folders to organize your ebooks
- Delete files and folders

## Prerequisites

- Your CrossPoint Reader device
- A WiFi network
- A computer, phone, or tablet connected to the **same WiFi network**

---

## Step 1: Accessing the WiFi Screen

1. From the main menu or file browser, navigate to the **Settings** screen
2. Select the **WiFi** option
3. The device will automatically start scanning for available networks

---

## Step 2: Connecting to WiFi

### Viewing Available Networks

Once the scan completes, you'll see a list of available WiFi networks with the following indicators:

- **Signal strength bars** (`||||`, `|||`, `||`, `|`) - Shows connection quality
- **`*` symbol** - Indicates the network is password-protected (encrypted)
- **`+` symbol** - Indicates you have previously saved credentials for this network

### Selecting a Network

1. Use the **Left/Right** (or **Volume Up/Down**) buttons to navigate through the network list
2. Press **Confirm** to select the highlighted network

### Entering Password (for encrypted networks)

If the network requires a password:

1. An on-screen keyboard will appear
2. Use the navigation buttons to select characters
3. Press **Confirm** to enter each character
4. When complete, select the **Done** option on the keyboard

**Note:** If you've previously connected to this network, the saved password will be used automatically.

### Connection Process

The device will display "Connecting..." while establishing the connection. This typically takes 5-10 seconds.

### Saving Credentials

If this is a new network, you'll be prompted to save the password:

- Select **Yes** to save credentials for automatic connection next time (NOTE: These are stored in plaintext on the device's SD card. Do not use this for sensitive networks.)
- Select **No** to connect without saving

---

## Step 3: Connection Success

Once connected, the screen will display:

- **Network name** (SSID)
- **IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.102`)
- **Web server URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.102/`)

   - Example: `http://192.168.1.102/`
4. Tap Go

## Command Line File Management

For power users, you can manage files directly from your terminal using `curl` while the device is in File Upload mode. 

### Uploading a File
To upload a file to the root directory, use the following command:
```bash
curl -F "file=@book.epub" "http://crosspoint.local/upload?path=/"
```

* **`-F "file=@filename"`**: Points to the local file on your computer.
* **`path=/`**: The destination folder on the device SD card.

### Deleting a File

To delete a specific file, provide the full path on the SD card:

```bash
curl -F "path=/folder/file.epub" "http://crosspoint.local/delete"
```

### Advanced Flags

For more reliable transfers of large EPUB files, consider adding these flags:

* `-#`: Shows a simple progress bar.
* `--connect-timeout 30`: Limits how long curl waits to establish a connection (in seconds).
* `--max-time 300`: Sets a maximum duration for the entire transfer (5 minutes).

> [!NOTE]
> These examples use `crosspoint.local`. If your network does not support mDNS or the address does not resolve, replace it with the specific **IP Address** displayed on your device screen (e.g., `http://192.168.1.102/`).

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot See the Device on the Network

**Problem:** Browser shows "Cannot connect" or "Site can't be reached"

**Solutions:**

1. Verify both devices are on the **same WiFi network**
   - Check your computer/phone WiFi settings
   - Confirm the CrossPoint Reader shows "Connected" status
2. Double-check the IP address
   - Make sure you typed it correctly
   - Include `http://` at the beginning
3. Try disabling VPN if you're using one
4. Some networks have "client isolation" enabled - check with your network administrator

### Connection Drops or Times Out

**Problem:** WiFi connection is unstable

**Solutions:**

1. Move closer to the WiFi router
2. Check signal strength on the device (should be at least `||` or better)
3. Avoid interference from other devices
4. Try a different WiFi network if available

### Upload Fails

**Problem:** File upload doesn't complete or shows an error

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure the file is a valid `.epub` file
2. Check that the SD card has enough free space
3. Try uploading a smaller file first to test
4. Refresh the browser page and try again

### Saved Password Not Working

**Problem:** Device fails to connect with saved credentials

**Solutions:**

1. When connection fails, you'll be prompted to "Forget Network"
2. Select **Yes** to remove the saved password
3. Reconnect and enter the password again
4. Choose to save the new password

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Organize with folders** - Create folders before uploading to keep your library organized
2. **Check signal strength** - Stronger signals (`|||` or `||||`) provide faster, more reliable uploads
3. **Upload multiple files** - You can upload files one at a time; the page refreshes after each upload
4. **Use descriptive names** - Name your folders clearly (e.g., "SciFi", "Mystery", "Non-Fiction")
5. **Keep credentials saved** - Save your WiFi password for quick reconnection in the future
6. **Exit when done** - Press **Back** to exit the WiFi screen and save battery
